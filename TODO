1. Toast endpoint should require data, don't respond with last recorded forecast
2. Implement listener to nws instead of hard-coded file
3. Update instead of Insert on forecasts (minimize db size)
4. HTTP templating for slack messages
5. Setup slack app commands/webhooks
6. User friendly slack commands (City, State instead of city, state, county to get forecast?)
