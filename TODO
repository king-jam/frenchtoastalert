DONE    2. Update instead of Insert on forecasts (minimize db size)
DONE    3. Implement listener to nws instead of hard-coded file


1. Toast endpoint should require data, don't respond with last recorded forecast



4. HTTP templating for slack messages
5. Setup slack app commands/webhooks
6. User friendly slack commands (City, State instead of city, state, county to get forecast?)
7. Run scraper on program start, then after time interval (right now its after time interval)
8. Change API to not kill listener on no data (400 on bad request, 404 on not found)
